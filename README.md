# **Automated Testing for SauceDemo**

This project is a data-driven automated testing framework for [**SauceDemo**](https://www.saucedemo.com) written in Python, designed to validate UI functionality, 
login authentication, shopping cart operations, and performance. It includes tests for user interactions, visual consistency, and system responsiveness, ensuring a seamless e-commerce experience.

The results of the tests can be viewed here: [**Allure Report**](https://enerko.github.io/saucedemo-selenium-tests/)

This framework supports:
- CI/CD workflows with GitHub Actions
- Allure reports generated automatically 
- Headless execution for faster and efficient tests
- Test categorization (UI, performance, functional)
- Data-driven tests

The tests are implemented using:
- **Selenium** for automating web browser interactions.
- **Chrome WebDriver** to run tests on Chrome.
- **Pytest** for organizing, running, and reporting tests.
- **Allure** for visual test reports
- **GitHub Actions** for CI/CD workflows and deploying allure reports
